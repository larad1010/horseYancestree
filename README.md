In the manuscript, we analyzed Y-chromosomal patterns in 1,517 stallions of 189 breeds from 60 different geographic regions, representing the worldwide horse population. Our Y chromosomal findings genetically traced the past 1,500 years of human-horse interactions that shaped today’s modern horse breeds. We pinpointed the impact of very recent intensive breeding strategies, and uncovered two major historic ’wheels‘ that fueled the dissemination of horses. Last, we showed how Y chromosome can be used as a genetic marker to uncover ancestry and breeding history of any modern horse breed of interest.
