In the manuscript, we analyzed Y-chromosomal patterns in 1,517 stallions of 189 breeds from numerous geographic regions, representing the worldwide horse population. Our Y chromosomal findings genetically traced the past 1,500 years of human-horse interactions that shaped today’s modern horse breeds. We pinpointed the impact of very recent intensive breeding strategies, and uncovered two major historic dissemination routes of stallions. Last, we established and exemplified an approach for ancestry tracing in any breed of interest.
